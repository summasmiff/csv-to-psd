Problems: 
//0. How to access elements of a hash in Ruby
	//Test: write a small hash, access one key
//1. How to access elements of a nested hash in Ruby
	//Problem: no implicit conversion of Symbol into Integer (TypeError)
		=>Array inside nested hash causes this error
		=>Cleanup hash contents?

		=>Use psd gem parse function to test for text layers. Success!

	//test: ap :text :value to console

//2. How to edit hash in ruby
	//test: update text from sample hash

//. How to edit hash values with a find and replace
	//test: find and replace values in a sample hash

//4. Use a CSV as a source dictionary for a find and replace
	//problem: what data structure for csv? hash to hash seems easiest for key value comparisons
	//loop thru, checking matches for keys and replacing with values

5. How to update CSV?


!!6. How to push edits to PSD
	test: push 4.'s update to PSD
	!! -> psd gem does not support editing/writing psd files !!

Pseudocode:
-Import csv
	Check CSV for col 2 for each col 1
	If col 2 missing:
		log to console(?), skip that row when translating
			nevermind - skip checking here - easier later
-Import PSD
	(Check PSD for text layers)?
	!! cannot write to psd anyway >:O

-Check 1st layer of PSD for :value and :name matching CSV key
	If match: 
		replace :value and :name of PSD with CSV value from same row
		update CSV row 3
	Else, move to next PSD layer
	Loop thru all layers

{
    :children => [
        [0] {
                     :type => :layer,
                  :visible => true,
                  :opacity => 1.0,
            :blending_mode => "normal",
              :layer_comps => {},
                     :name => "cat",
                     :left => 497,
                    :right => 672,
                      :top => 509,
                   :bottom => 597,
                   :height => 88,
                    :width => 175,
                     :text => {
                    :value => "cat",
