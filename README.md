==========
Translation documents are often delivered as CSVs with the original text in one column and the replacement text in the next.

The PSD gem will export Photoshop layer data as a nested hash, including any text object layers. 
==========
Unfortunately, the PSD gem does not support writing to a PSD, so no direct editing of a PSD file can be done currently.

This script:
1. Reads a CSV file that contains two columns, "Original" and "Translation".

2. If the sample contains any matches with the CSV "Original" column, it replaces it with the corresponding "Translation".

3. The CSV "Translation" is then updated with a third column, "Success".

Repository includes samples .csv and .psd files to test.
