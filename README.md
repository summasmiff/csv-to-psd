csv-to-psd
==========
Translation documents are often delivered as CSVs with the original text in one column and the replacement text in the next.
The PSD gem will export Photoshop layer data as a nested hash, including any text object layers. 

Theoretically, I can directly update the text in a Photoshop document from a CSV.
